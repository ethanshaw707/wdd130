        Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we approach healthcare and medicine. It is touching every area of the field, from research to diagnosis. The growth of big data and computational power in the last 5 years alone is astonishing. The implementation can be observed in robotic surgeries, patient monitoring, drug development, and various hospital operations. AI has forever changed the game, and it is just getting started. 
        Why Visit the Site?
	      This website is going to be a place to understand the impact 
        of AI in the medical field. It will benefit patients, 
        healthcare professionals, students, investors, and people interested in the subject. 
        The main purpose is for education, so that people can take an advanced concept and understand it better. There are many difficult things to understand with AI, such as reading radiology scans, automating medical routines, and preventative care. For professionals, some advanced, cutting-edge technologies will be discussed, and for the general public, they can see how AI might affect their future medical care. It can also be a place to look at potential ways to get involved. 
        General Benefits of AI in Medicine
	      AI is able to do some things faster and with more accuracy than humans. Algorithms are able to scan complex images and have already performed better than seasoned radiologists. Robotic-assisted surgeries are already leading to more precise surgery, with quicker healing times and smaller incisions. AI is also improving personalized care, as it is able to preform predictive analytics, which asses patient data to predict health events before they occur. This means faster diagnosis, earlier intervention, and fewer medical errors.

      <h3>Potential Employment</h3>
      <p>
        Growing Market and Demand
        AI in the medical industry is expected to grow to over 613 billion by the year 2034. This growth will surely create many jobs and business opportunities. There will be an increase in demand for people who understand AI and people who understand data science. It will be important for nearly every company in the world to have people that can build, train, and maintain AI systems. 
        Emerging AI-Focused Roles
        AI is creating new job roles that didn’t exist even a decade ago. These include:

        Clinical Data Analysts who clean and interpret healthcare datasets for machine learning models.
        Medical AI Software Developers who design tools for diagnostics, virtual assistants, and robotics.
        Healthcare Data Engineers who build the systems that support AI integration across hospital networks.
        Ethics and Compliance Officers focused on ensuring fairness, transparency, and HIPAA-compliance in AI use.
        Opportunities for Students and Career Changers
	      There are many pathways into the AI-medical industry. There is a need for students of nursing, medicine, IT, and data science in the field. There are certification programs and master’s degrees available to get into the field. These are degrees like a master's in biomedical data science or AI in healthcare. Current healthcare professionals also have the opportunity to learn and potentially shape their career toward a more tech-heavy role. 
        Entrepreneurship and Innovation
        Beyond jobs in large-well established companies, there are opportunities in startups and entrepreneurship. There are many emerging apps and devices that need development, such as medical apps, telehealth platforms, wearable integration tools, and remote monitoring devices. Entrepreneurs who are able to fill a need for patients using AI are likely to have a large impact in the coming days.

      <h3>Real-World Applications</h3>
      <p>
        AI in Diagnostics and Imaging
        One of the most impactful integrations of AI so far has been in diagnostic imaging. AI is able to identify patterns and trends in things like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. They have already been shown to be more accurate than radiologists. Tools like Google’s DeepMind and PathAI is able to detect cancer, tumors, and fractures. A study by UCLA showed that AI was able to detect prostate cancer at an 84% clip, compared to 67% by doctors.
        Surgical Robotics and Automation
        AI-powered robots are already increasing the precision and accuracy of surgeries. Right now, they are mostly there to assist the doctor, but many imagine a world where robots are able to replace the need for a human surgeon completely. The assistant robots help with small incisions, faster recovery, lower risk, and even remote-assisted surgeries in rural areas. 
        Drug Discovery and Personalized Treatment
        AI  helps pharmaceutical companies discover drugs by using predictions for how compounds will behave and what could potentially help. AI is able to use patient data and even analyze genetics to create personalized treatment plans, which improves the success rates and can create effective preventative care.
