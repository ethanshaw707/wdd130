          <h3>Drug Discovery and Personalized Treatment</h3>
          <p>AI helps pharmaceutical companies discover drugs by using predictions for how compounds will behave and what could potentially help. AI is able to use patient data and even analyze genetics to create personalized treatment plans, which improves the success rates and can create effective preventative care.</p>

          <h3>AI in Diagnostics and Imaging</h3>
          <p>One of the most impactful integrations of AI so far has been in diagnostic imaging. AI is able to identify patterns and trends in things like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. They have already been shown to be more accurate than radiologists. Tools like Googleâ€™s DeepMind and PathAI is able to detect cancer, tumors, and fractures. A study by UCLA showed that AI was able to detect prostate cancer at an 84% clip, compared to 67% by doctors.</p>

          <h3>Surgical Robotics and Automation</h3>
          <p>AI-powered robots are already increasing the precision and accuracy of surgeries. Right now, they are mostly there to assist the doctor, but many imagine a world where robots are able to replace the need for a human surgeon completely. The assistant robots help with small incisions, faster recovery, lower risk, and even remote-assisted surgeries in rural areas.</p>

          <h3>Wearable Devices</h3>
          <p>Wearable devices, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, are revolutionizing healthcare by continuously collecting real-time health data like heart rate, activity levels, sleep patterns, and even blood oxygen saturation. AI algorithms analyze this data to detect anomalies, predict potential health issues, and provide personalized health recommendations. These devices empower patients to monitor their own health, enable early detection of conditions such as arrhythmias or sleep apnea, and allow healthcare providers to deliver more proactive and preventative care. The integration of AI with wearables is making healthcare more accessible, data-driven, and tailored to individual needs.</p>
