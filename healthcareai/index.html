        <h2>Welcome to AI in Healthcare</h2>
        <p>Artificial intelligence is transforming the way we approach healthcare and medicine. It is touching every area of the field, from research to diagnosis. The growth of big data and computational power in the last 5 years alone is astonishing. The implementation can be observed in robotic surgeries, patient monitoring, drug development, and various hospital operations. AI has forever changed the game, and it is just getting started.</p>
        <p>This website is a place to understand the impact of AI in the medical field. It will benefit patients, healthcare professionals, students, investors, and people interested in the subject. The main purpose is for education, so that people can take an advanced concept and understand it better. There are many difficult things to understand with AI, such as reading radiology scans, automating medical routines, and preventative care. For professionals, some advanced, cutting-edge technologies will be discussed, and for the general public, they can see how AI might affect their future medical care. It can also be a place to look at potential ways to get involved.</p>

        <h3>General Benefits of AI in Medicine</h3>
        <p>AI is able to do some things faster and with more accuracy than humans. Algorithms are able to scan complex images and have already performed better than seasoned radiologists. Robotic-assisted surgeries are already leading to more precise surgery, with quicker healing times and smaller incisions. AI is also improving personalized care, as it is able to perform predictive analytics, which assess patient data to predict health events before they occur. This means faster diagnosis, earlier intervention, and fewer medical errors.</p>
