    </h2>
    <p>I am a Data Science Major! I am currently a Senior here at BYU-Idaho. I currently want
        to become a Data Scientist, and web development will give me a great foundation for HTML. I love to go hiking,
        play video games, and spend time with my family. I currently am looking for internships to kickstart my career in Data Science.
        The thing that I love most about BYU-Idaho is the culture and the Spirit that is felt here. From this course
        I am hoping to have a great foundation for creating websites, and I am working on several projects to help build websites for companies, so this class will help me with that goal.
        I hope to also learn a lot about CSS, and how I can really make a website look good.
        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my whole life, and I love the teachings of President Russell M. Nelson.

    Here are some of my favorite quotes and scriptures:

    Doctrine and Covenants 6:36 "Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not."
